## 🔬 Current Research Interests

### 🌍 Change Detection in Satellite Imagery  
I’m exploring advanced techniques for identifying and quantifying changes over time using satellite data.  
- Designing models to detect subtle temporal shifts in land use and infrastructure  
- Fusing multi-sensor inputs (optical, SAR, etc.) for greater accuracy and robustness  
- Focused applications: environmental monitoring, disaster impact analysis, and urban expansion tracking  

### 🧪 Weakly Supervised Learning  
My work aims to push the boundaries of deep learning with minimal supervision.  
- Creating frameworks that learn from sparse, noisy, or incomplete annotations  
- Key use cases include anomaly detection and semantic segmentation  
- Goal: reduce labeling overhead while preserving model performance at scale
