      <h2>👋 Hey there, I'm Ramesh</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a Senior Applied Machine Learning Engineer with 7+ years of experience building computer vision systems that make sense of the world — from deep forests to dense urban grids — using satellite imagery and geospatial data.
        My work lives at the intersection of AI, environmental monitoring, and scalable system design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thrive on turning research ideas into real-world products, and I believe in using machine learning not just for automation, but for planetary impact.

      <h2>🚀 What I'm Working On</h2>
      <p>
        At <strong>Planet Labs</strong>, I lead the development of robust ML pipelines that power large-scale satellite imagery analytics. Here’s what I’m currently focused on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Building high-performance detection and segmentation models for infrastructure and land use</li>
        <li>Designing weakly supervised learning workflows for rapid model iteration</li>
        <li>Developing multi-modal fusion strategies across temporal, spectral, and SAR data</li>
        <li>Scaling ML pipelines for global coverage with minimal latency</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I’m also deeply involved in improving model interpretability and collaborating across teams to deploy solutions that are used by scientists, governments, and humanitarian organizations.

      <h2>📚 A Bit of Background</h2>
      <p>
        I hold a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering from <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>, where I focused on computer vision and pattern recognition. Prior to Planet, I was at <strong>Siemens Corporate Research</strong>, working on novel approaches in anomaly detection and segmentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        My work has been published at top-tier conferences like ICML, and I also hold a patent in weakly supervised learning.
