## üìù Conference Papers

- **Detecting Building Growth in High Flood Risk Regions Across African Cities**  
  _ICML 2019 Workshop on Climate Change and AI_  
  Co-authored with the Planet Labs research team, this paper (<https://www.climatechange.ai/papers/icml2019/24.pdf>) explores the use of satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor urban expansion in flood-prone zones. The goal: to inform climate resilience strategies in rapidly developing areas.

## üß† Patents

- **Weakly Supervised Visual Anomaly Detection and Segmentation**  
  _US Patent No: US10672115B2_  
  This patent introduces a novel method for training deep learning models with sparse or noisy labels. Originally developed for industrial visual inspection, the approach has since influenced broader applications in quality control and monitoring systems.

## üìò Technical Reports

- **Multi-sensor Fusion for Change Detection in Satellite Imagery**  
  _Internal Report | Planet Labs_  
  A deep dive into integrating data from diverse satellite sensors (optical, radar, etc.) to enhance the accuracy of change detection models. Includes real-world case studies in environmental and infrastructure monitoring.

- **Scalable Deep Learning Pipelines for Satellite Imagery**  
  _Internal Report | Planet Labs_  
  Covers the design and optimization of large-scale ML systems for processing satellite data at global scale. Focuses on architecture, model orchestration, and performance tuning for production deployments.
