    <h1>Hi, I'm Ramesh ðŸ‘‹</h1>

    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet. Iâ€™m a curious mind, tech tinkerer, and machine learning engineer whoâ€™s passionate about solving real-world problems through computer vision and deep learning.</p>

    <p>Right now, I lead ML efforts at <strong>Planet Labs</strong>, where I work on cutting-edge models that make sense of satellite imagery â€” from tracking environmental changes to mapping infrastructure across the globe. I love turning messy, high-dimensional data into actionable insights.</p>

    <p>Before this, I was at <strong>Siemens Corporate Research</strong>, working on visual anomaly detection and segmentation problems. Iâ€™ve published my work in top-tier conferences like ICML and hold a patent in weakly supervised learning domain.</p>

    <p>I earned my Masterâ€™s degree from <strong>Rochester Institute of Technology</strong>, and Iâ€™ve been exploring the intersection of geospatial data, AI, and real-world impact ever since.</p>

    <p>Outside of tech, youâ€™ll find me running, biking, or globe-trotting. Iâ€™m endlessly curious about other cultures and love the stories hidden in unfamiliar places.</p>

    <p>This site is a living portfolio of my projects, research, and ideas. Feel free to explore, and if anything sparks your interest â€” Iâ€™d love to connect! Just scroll down to find my links in the footer.</p>
