# About me

I'm Ramesh Nair, a Senior Applied Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for solving complex problems using computer vision and deep learning. I'm particularly interested in developing innovative solutions that make a real impact in the world.

Currently, I lead the machine learning team at Planet Labs, where we work on cutting-edge projects involving satellite imagery analysis and environmental monitoring. My work focuses on building robust machine learning systems that can process and analyze large-scale geospatial data.

Previously, I worked at Siemens Corporate Research, where I developed novel approaches for visual anomaly detection and segmentation. My research has been published in prestigious conferences like ICML, and I hold a patent for my work in weakly supervised learning.

This website serves as a portfolio of my work and achievements in the field of computer vision and machine learning. You can explore my projects, research, and publications to learn more about my work.
